        <h3>Python Programming Course</h3>
        <p>The course teaches you the essential concepts of Python programming, and gives you an in-depth knowledge in data analytics, machine learning, data visualization, web scraping, and natural language processing. You will master the essential concepts of data types, tuples, lists, dicts, basic operators, and functions.</p>
        <h3>R Programming Course</h3>
        
        <p>If you are interested in doing statistical analysis and data visualization, then R would be a good choice. If you are interested in working with databases, then SQL would be a better choice. If you are unsure which one to choose, you could consider learning both, as they can be used together in many different ways.</p>
        <h3>SAS Programming Course</h3>
        
        <p>SAS is the full form of Statistical Analysis Software, comprising a variety of data management tools and algorithms. The system stores, analyses, and retrieves information for identifying patterns and reporting.</p>
        <h3>Java Programming Course</h3>
        <p>Enrolling in an introductory Java course online can help students learn everything from the basics of computer functioning to how Java allows programmers to manipulate those functions. Students may also study object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java, which is the foundation of many programming languages.</p>
        <h3>JavaScript Course</h3>
        <p>Arguably, JavaScript is one of the easiest programming languages to learn, so it serves as a great first language for anyone brand new to coding. Even the most complex lines of JavaScript code can be written one by one, in fragments. It can also be tested in the web browser at the same time.</p>
        <h3>AngularJS Course</h3>
        <p>AngularJS has a learning curve similar to a hockey stick, which means starting with the framework is easy. However, building complex applications require more effort and an understanding of AngularJS' framework.</p>
        <h3>C Programming Course</h3>
        <p>This specialization course on C programming offered by Coursera is the best one for beginners to learn. It is a beginner-level course that offers you a flexible schedule to learn.</p>
        <h3>Linux Programming Course</h3>
        <p>Can I learn Linux by myself?
            You can learn the basic Linux commands in a few days but it will likely take a few weeks to become more familiar with these commands. More advanced commands may take years for full mastery. The Linux command line is known for the degree of customization it supports.</p>
        <h3>Node.js Course</h3>
        <p>It takes around 3 months to fully learn Node JS and be able to build a functional full-stack application. If you already know some other programming, you can get the basics down within a few week's time. This is because there are so many moving parts that go into building a working app such as a social network.</p>
        <h3>C++ Programming Course</h3>  
        <p>C++ is one of the hardest programming languages to learn due to its wide range of paradigms. To learn C++ with less difficulty, you might first get familiar with other programming languages. This previous experience can help you understand its advanced syntax and scale through.</p>
