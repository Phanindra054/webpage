           <p id="x">Changing Expectations Receives Generous Grant from Google to Launch Closing the AI Education Gap Initiative</p>
           <p id="x">[Austin, Texas - 7/07/2023] - Changing Expectations, a leading nonprofit organization empowering Black youth in STEM education, is thrilled to announce a substantial grant from Google to launch the Closing the AI Education Gap Initiative. This transformative initiative aims to address the racial disparity in computer science education by supporting the implementation of an innovative artificial intelligence (AI) curriculum.</p>
           <p id="x">With the generous grant from Google, Changing Expectations is poised to make a significant impact on AI education for Black students and educators nationwide. The Closing the AI Education Gap Initiative will support the Computer Science Teachers Association's (CSTA) Black Affinity Group, providing Black computer science educators with essential tools and resources to excel in teaching AI and promote diversity within the field.</p>
           <p id="x">“To put it simply, they took me 8 years ago and introduced me to the field of AI and just coding and technology.  As I am now graduating high school, I am going to college at an engineering school studying computer and electrical engineering.  It all stems down from the [Changing Expectations] My Brother’s Keeper Coding Makerspace introducing me to this field.”</p>
            <p id="x">According to a recent report from the Proceedings of the 54th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, only 6.6% of math and computer science teachers were Black during the 2017-18 academic year, highlighting the urgent need for increased diversity and inclusion in computer science classrooms. Through the Closing the AI Education Gap Initiative, Changing Expectations aims to bridge this gap and cultivate a new generation of Black computer science educators who will inspire and guide future Black technologists.</p>

            <p id="x">"We are incredibly grateful to Google for their generous grant, which will enable us to empower Black educators and students with the skills and knowledge necessary to thrive in AI and computer science," said Dr. Phillip Eaglin, Founder at Changing Expectations. "This grant represents a transformative opportunity to make lasting changes in the field of AI education and contribute to a more equitable and inclusive future."</p>
           <p id="x">The Closing the AI Education Gap Initiative will provide comprehensive support for Black computer science educators across the United States, including access to AI curriculum modules designed to address culturally relevant issues such as combating anti-Black violence in online and in-person spaces. By fostering a more inclusive and representative learning environment, this initiative aims to amplify the voices of Black students, tackle systemic barriers, and create pathways to success in AI and related fields.</p>    
           <p id="x">Changing Expectations invites media outlets, education advocates, and supporters of diversity in computing to join them in celebrating the launch of the Closing the AI Education Gap Initiative. For further inquiries, interview requests, or more information, please contact:</p>
